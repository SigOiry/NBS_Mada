    "text": "Sentinel-2 images where downloaded from the Copernicus DataSpace portal. The images were acquired at Level-1C and atmospherically corrected using ACOLITE, an atmospheric correction processor specifically adapted for aquatic applications and water-leaving reflectance retrieval (Vanhellemont & Ruddick, 2016). The resulting subsurface remote-sensing reflectance was then used as input for bathymetric retrieval. Bathymetry was estimated using the SAMBUCA (Semi-Analytical Model for Bathymetry, Un-mixing and Concentration Assessment) inversion approach, which relies on a physics-based radiative transfer model linking subsurface reflectance to water depth through the attenuation of light in the water column and the contribution of bottom reflectance. In this framework, water depth is retrieved by minimizing the difference between modeled and measured subsurface reflectance spectra, while constraining the solution using known optical properties of the water and bottom substrates.\nSince the present work focuses exclusively on water depth, only the depth parameter was retained from the SAMBUCA inversion, and no analysis of water-column constituents or benthic composition was performed. To ensure the reliability of the retrieved depths, only pixels corresponding to optically shallow waters, where the bottom signal contributes significantly to the surface reflectance, were retained using the substratum detectability index (SDI &gt; 5). \nA total of 29 images Sentinel-2 are exploitable between 2016 and 2025 (Table 1) . An image is considered usable when it is entirely cloud-free over the whole NBS farming area and when no significant sun-glint is present. Sun-glint introduces strong specular reflection at the water surface, which contaminates the water-leaving radiance and severely limits the retrieval of bottom reflectance at satellite level. Consequently, only images acquired under low-wind conditions and favorable sun–sensor geometry were retained to ensure reliable benthic information.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: List of cloud- and sun-glint-free Sentinel-2 images acquired over the NBS facilities. Acquisition times are expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and water heights at the time of image acquisition are given relative to the astronomical tide reference (astronomical height). All images were downloaded at the Level 1 of correction.\n\n\n\nAcquisition dateAcquisition time (UTC)Water Height (m)Acquisition date Acquisition time (UTC) Water Height (m) 2016-06-2507:02:320.602023-02-1907:02:011.002018-05-1107:02:291.802023-04-0507:02:090.902018-06-0507:02:311.452023-04-2507:02:091.102018-08-0907:02:192.052023-05-1507:02:092.052018-08-2407:02:311.502023-05-2007:02:110.752019-04-2607:02:391.552023-08-2307:02:091.402019-05-3107:02:311.902023-08-2807:02:112.002019-06-1007:02:311.752024-05-2407:02:010.902019-08-0907:02:312.052024-06-0807:02:090.652020-05-1507:02:311.502024-06-1307:02:111.902021-06-0907:00:511.302025-05-2107:02:411.702021-07-2407:00:490.952025-06-1307:01:591.002021-08-0807:00:511.052025-07-2307:02:091.752022-05-1007:00:491.602025-08-0207:02:091.80\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Map of the average depth of the lagoon of Sainte Marie island.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Relationship between latitude and median depth across all modules.
